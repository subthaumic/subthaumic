Hi, I'm a Postdoc based at the [Institute for Mathematics, Heidelberg University](https://www.math.uni-heidelberg.de/en) and associated to [STRUCTURES](https://www.structures.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php).

I recently finished my PhD in Mathematical Physics on connections between topologically twisted supersymmetric field theories, Floer theories, and knot homologies.

**Currently**, I'm switching gears and my **new project** revolves around geometric neighbour embeddings, with the goal of extracting dynamical information from single cell RNA velocity data during cell differentiation.

In general, I'm fascinated by the unreasonably effectiveness of abstract mathematical ideas in the natural sciences -- and vice versa.

I'm involved in [STRUCTURES EP Math and Data](https://wiki.structures.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/Main_Page) at Heidelberg University, which explores new developments in topological data analysis and geometric machine learning.

I have contributed to the creation of [CoVtRec](https://tdalife.github.io/covtrec/), which utilizes persistent homology to gain insights into the evolution of Sars-CoV-2.
