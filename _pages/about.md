Hi, I'm a Postdoc based at the Institute for Mathematics, Heidelberg University.

I recently finished my PhD in Mathematical Physics, where I explored connections between topologically twisted supersymmetric field theories, Floer theories, and knot homologies.
However, I'm generally fascinated by the unreasonably effectiveness of abstract mathematical ideas in the natural sciences -- and vice versa. 

**Currently**, my main project revolves around geometric neighbour embeddings, with the goal of extracting dynamical information from single cell RNA velocity data during cell differentiation.

I'm involved in [STRUCTURES EP Math and Data](https://wiki.structures.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/Main_Page) at Heidelberg University, which explores new developments in topological data analysis and geometric machine learning.

I have contributed to the creation of [CoVtRec](https://tdalife.github.io/covtrec/), which utilizes persistent homology to gain insights into the evolution of Sars-CoV-2.
