Hi, I'm a Postdoc based at the [Institute for Mathematics, Heidelberg University](https://www.math.uni-heidelberg.de/en), and associated with [STRUCTURES](https://www.structures.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php) and the ERC Grant [Perpetuating Stemness](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101071786).

I obtained a PhD in Mathematical Physics on connections between topologically twisted supersymmetric field theories, Floer theories, and knot homologies under the supervision of [Johannes Walcher](https://web.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/physmath/walcher).

Currently I'm investigating applications of geometry and topology in biology, with the ultimate goal of extracting dynamical information from single cell RNA velocity data during cell differentiation.
This research is part of the [Applied Analysis and Modelling in Biosciences](http://www.biostruct.uni-hd.de/index.php) group of [Anna Marciniak-Czochra](http://wwwagmarciniak.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/folder_people/Anna.Marciniak/index.html) and developed in collaboration with [Anna Wienhard](https://www.mis.mpg.de/de/people/anna-wienhard) at the [MPI MiS](https://www.mis.mpg.de/de/).

In general, I'm fascinated by the [unreasonable](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/unreasonable) [effectiveness](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/precise) [of abstract mathematics in the natural sciences](https://web.archive.org/web/20210212111540/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html) and vice versa. 
I'm always happy to chat about new examples and am looking forward to seeing Wigner being proven right again and again.
