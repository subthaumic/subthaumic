Hi, I'm a Postdoc based at the [Institute for Mathematics, Heidelberg University](https://www.math.uni-heidelberg.de/en) and associated to [STRUCTURES](https://www.structures.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php).

I recently finished my PhD in Mathematical Physics on connections between topologically twisted supersymmetric field theories, Floer theories, and knot homologies.

**Currently**, I'm switching gears and my **new project** revolves around geometric neighbour embeddings, with the goal of extracting dynamical information from single cell RNA velocity data during cell differentiation.

In general, I'm fascinated by the unreasonable effectiveness of abstract mathematical ideas in the natural sciences -- and vice versa.
