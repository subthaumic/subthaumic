abstract:
    This talk showcases a methodology for the rapid computation of persistent homology in pandemic-scale time series data of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. By focusing only on small genomic distance scales, which capture the selective advantages and deleterious effects of individual mutations relative to its progenitor, and encoding temporal information through a deformation of the metric, we are able to efficiently calculate homology classes for millions of unique viral sequences. We discuss the implementation challenges and solutions that have enabled us to process data at this scale and explain the biological insights we obtain about the evolutionary fitness landscape during the pandemic. Our method exemplifies the application of topology to large datasets, streamlining data analysis at unprecedented scales, while also enhancing our understanding of viral evolution by providing insights into mutation dynamics at a daily resolution.
