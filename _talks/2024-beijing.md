abstract:
    The Haydys-Witten equations are gauge theoretic partial differential equations on five-dimensional Riemannian manifolds that are equipped with a non-vanishing vector field. Conjecturally, their solutions on M^5=IR×W^4 determine the Floer differential in a gauge-theoretic approach to homological knot invariants. In this talk, I will provide a brief overview of this ‘instanton Floer theory of four-manifolds’ and then focus on a ‘decoupled’ version of the Haydys-Witten equations that emerges in the geometric setup for knot invariants. Since the latter exhibit a Hermitian Yang-Mills structure, these results may offer novel insights into the conjectured relationship to knot invariants.
