abstract: 
    RNA velocity data provides a snapshot of cell states and their current rate of change. It promises insights into the behaviour of individual cells and the dynamics governing cell division and differentiation processes. To explore single cell RNA-sequence data one often relies on low-dimensional visualizations, e.g. tSNE or UMAP. A priori it's not obvious how RNA velocities carry over to such representations and current methods have several drawbacks.  
    It was recently suggested that one should fix a biologically motivated, low-dimensional manifold and infer RNA velocities strictly in terms of an embedding of the data in that manifold. I expand on that idea and argue that low-dimensional representations of position-velocity pairs should utilize the Sasakian geometry on the tangent bundle of curved target spaces. Moreover, I propose that non-linear neighbour embeddings into low- or middle-dimensional symmetric spaces provide a geometric representation of the principal dynamical components in the data. This geometrization provides interesting future directions regarding the analysis of the dynamical processes captured in single cell data.
