New preprint: [An Algebraic Framework for the Modeling of Limit Order Books](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04969).
Accompanying [blog post here](https://open.substack.com/pub/subthaumic/p/an-algebraic-framework-for-limit?r=2ozoae&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web).
This is in continuation of earlier work on limit order books with my brother, Johannes Bleher, University of Hohenheim.
